Building AI Course Project - Agentic AI system based on personal shared information available on line


## Summary

Everyday we share lot of personal information to different on line services (geolocazation, social network, seach engines, ecommerce, etc). What if all this information could be used to train an AI SLM to create an AI agent able to act as myself? 


## Phases
### Phase 1
* Teach who I am to an AI SML(Phi-4 in evaluation).
* Interact with the model via text.

### Phase 2
* Connect to on line services using API.
* Normalize data structure.
* Use this data to teach AI SML about me.
* Interact with the model via text.

### Phase 3
* Create an AI Agent being able to act via a browser
* Interact with the model via voice

### Phase 4
* Extend AI Agent direct integration with other platforms (apps, etc)


## AI models
Microsoft Phi-4 (in evaluation) [Microsoft Phi-4](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4)

## Data Sources
* [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
* Other APIs


## Challenges
Is it possibile to get my data from on line services and add them as training data for the SLM? 


## What next?
Offer this solution to everyone.
